#The import statement is used to include external modules or specific functions from libraries
#into your Python program, it is possible to create specific libraries of our own.

#import math - to import the whole library
#from math import * (similar to the above one)

#from math import trunc - To import just a specific thing form a library (this case trunc)


#Start to use it on practice 16, and to prepare own modules on 107.
