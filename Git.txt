Global information Tracker (GIT)
GIT = VCS = VERSION CONTROL SOFTWARE
GitHUB = Social Platform for programmers

Git is local repository while GitHUB is remote repository

Course topics:

PUSH to origin - Put it online (from local to network)
PULL from origin - Take from online (from network to local)

* Clone: Can get another person work in your local machine, nothing that is change in your machine will affect the
original, unless you make a fork and ask to pull request new info to the project

* Forks: Can get another person work in your GitHub, in this one you can change freely without affect the original,
in case you want to add the original you need to open a pull request and the owner accept it.

* Issues: It is a like a ticket used to track bugs, feature requests, tasks and discussion about the project. It is
possible to use  markdown code here.

* The normal order of work is : Fork → Clone → Edit → Push → Pull Request

* Branches: similar to an alternate timeline for the project, it's good to make changes to the project and test. It is
possible to make loads of them, it is useful in case of teams where someone for example works with the HTML, another
one with CSS, other with java and in the end all can have their branch and import to the main project.

* HTML website: I's possible to host simple websites made by HTML in github.


GitHub Markdown (common mark) : I use on readme.md, issues and pool request
They want to be easier to convert to HTML... Jupyter also use it...

Numbered list:
1. Test1
1. Test2
1. Test3

or (no matter the number, it will follow order)

1. Test1
2. Test2
3. Test3

to add subtopics
1. Test1
 1. Sub1
  1. Sub2
   1. Sub3
2. Test2

Demarked list: Can be * or -
* Test
* Test
 * Test

Work lists: (with x inside are checkboxes completed)
- [x] Add code
- [x] Check code
- [] Push code
- [] email client

Images: max 400 pixels de width/high are advisable
Drag and drop the image to the GitHub, it will automatically generate the link with [], everything inside the [], is the
name of my image.

Links:
[Access my GitHub](https://github.com/mcoradini1)
[Hyperlink] (link)

Tables:
Num | Name | Grade    (FIRST TITLE LINE)
---|---|---           (CLOSE TITLE LINE)
1|Marlon|10           (SECOND LINE)
2|Susana|20           (THIRD LINE)

Program Commands:
'print('Test')'   It will show it like a code. (grey background and easier to see)



If I use ''', I can write the program inside it...

'''
num = int(input('Type your number '
if num % 2 == 0
 print(num)
else
 print('wrong')
'''

EMOJIS: just add : and put the name. Don't work on issue titles. to do that I need to coy and paste the real moj from
emojpedia.org.

:hands
:strong
:monkey

QUOTATION: I use @ to do that. It will give some options (usually people from the issue, but can add others)
I can quote specific replies as well, just go to ... of the specific message, and it will be quoted/coded automatically.
